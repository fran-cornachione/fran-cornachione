# Hey, I'm Fran!

I'm passionate about data. I'm currently on a self-taught journey to become a **Data Engineer**, focusing on building data pipelines, automation, and working with large-scale datasets efficiently.

Right now, I'm deepening my technical skills by building real-world projects that combine data engineering and analytics.
